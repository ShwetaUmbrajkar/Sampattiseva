ScrapConnect

Overview

ScrapConnect is a web platform designed to streamline scrap recycling in India by connecting households with raddi walas (scrap collectors). Users can list scrap items (e.g., newspapers, plastics, electronics), view estimated prices, and schedule pickups, while raddi walas can access jobs efficiently. This project was developed for a hackathon, showcasing a user dashboard with mock data, with plans to add a full backend and AI-driven matching in the future.

Problem

India generates 62 million tons of waste annually, but only 15% is recycled due to inefficient connections between households and raddi walas. This leads to landfill overflow and lost economic opportunities.

Solution

ScrapConnect provides:
A user dashboard to log in, list scrap items, and view estimated prices.
A planned raddi wala dashboard to view and accept nearby scrap jobs.
Future AI integration to match users with collectors based on location and scrap type.

Features (Current Demo)
Login Page: Users can log in.
User Dashboard: Displays listed scrap items (e.g., newspaper, plastic) with weights and estimated prices.
List Item: Users can add new scrap items, which appear instantly on the dashboard.
Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for a front-end-only demo.

Tech Stack
