üõ†Ô∏è SAMPATTISEVA ‚Äì ScrapConnect

üìå Overview
ScrapConnect is a web-based platform developed to streamline and digitize the scrap (raddi) recycling process in India. It aims to bridge the gap between households and local scrap collectors (raddi walas) by enabling users to list their scrap items online and schedule pickups, while providing raddi walas access to nearby collection opportunities.
This prototype was built during a hackathon, featuring a responsive front-end user dashboard with mock data. A complete backend and AI-powered matching system are part of the future roadmap.

üöÆ Problem
India generates 62 million tons of waste every year, yet only 15% is recycled effectively. The core issues include:

Lack of structured platforms for households to reach scrap collectors.
Missed economic potential from recyclable materials.
Increased pressure on landfills and the environment.
üí° Solution
ScrapConnect proposes a digital solution to transform scrap management through:

A User Dashboard for logging in, listing scrap items (e.g., newspapers, plastic, electronics), and viewing estimated resale prices.
A planned Raddi Wala Dashboard to help scrap collectors view, accept, and manage pickup requests.
Future integration of AI-based matching to connect users and collectors based on scrap type, location, and availabilit

Tech Stack
